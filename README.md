# IPDownApp
An application for red cybersecurity equipment for exclusively educational purposes created on Android and uses an open source API through the Retrofit 2 library.

On the one hand IPDownApp is able to show the user his own public and private IP, and throw geographic information, as well as the location through a WebView connected to GoogleMaps, both of the user himself, and on any target IP that he previously chooses. 

On the other hand, IPDownApp is capable of carrying out a DDOS attack on the IP that the user wants. The user must type the target IP, select the sending method GET or POST and choose a number of threads, which will attack individually, thus generating an obstruction of the communication channel.
